      <p>
        I am a passionate and skilled web developer with a strong foundation in front-end development. 
        I have hands-on experience in designing and building dynamic, responsive web applications using 
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As a beginner, I am very enthusiastic to associate myself with a company 
        that can sow the seeds of my career. I am excited about the opportunity to leverage my skills and 
        experience to make meaningful contributions in the ever-evolving field of technology.
